# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

```
testnet
npx hardhat run --network goerli ./scripts/1_deploy.ts
npx hardhat verify --network <network> {{address}} "param1" "param2"
npx hardhat flatten contracts/Inputcontract.sol > OutPutContract.sol
```

```
